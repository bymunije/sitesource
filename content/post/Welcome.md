Hello and welcome to my personal site/blog. This'll mostly be a place where I blog about technical challenges I face in projects, and probably rant into the abyss. There'll also probably be some tutorials and such sprinkled in if I find a topic that hasn't been well documented that I needed to learn about. 

This site's been made with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a modified edition of the [Hugo Nuo theme](https://github.com/laozhu/hugo-nuo) and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is still a work in progress, so the style and content may change frequently. If you'd like to take a look at the source code it's hosted [here](https://github.com/ripbandit/sitesource). 

I think that wraps up this inaugural blog post, thanks for reading!
